		Aspiring to be a leading institute in the field of providing educational services and recognised for it's innovation and Quality in teaching techniques. Mentor Classrooms offers Quality faculty accompanied with modernised methods of teaching. We are a comprehensive private institution,
		educating a diverse student body, preparing students for leadership and lifelong learning in a multicultural world. We will guide a student through each and every step in their learning process. No students shall remain unattended, each and every student will be given undivided attention so that their learning experience becomes smooth.
		Despite having knowledge many students are unable to secure marks due to some void in their learning. We provide detailed instructions to fill those voids and to maintain brilliant marks throughout.</p>
		<p>Our students are entitled to have a <strong>one on one interaction</strong> with their respective teachers beyond the boundaries of classes.</p>
		<p>Smaller batches with a <strong>maximum batch strength of 5 students</strong> enables our teachers to provide <strong>individual attention</strong> to each student and their respective problems.</p>
		<p>We encourage curiosity, passion and thirst for learning and thus <strong>audio visual presentations and interactive learning sessions</strong> are conducted at regular intervals.</p>
		<p>We provide Online assistance to the students and create a link between the students and their respective teachers where the questions and the answers with explanations can be discussed over mails
		as far as applicable</p>
		<p>Exclusive <strong>study materials in ppt formats and word docs</strong> are to be provided in order to ease the process of learning and making a student get acquainted to presentations and its process of making as well.</p>
		<p>We would also like to mention that prior to formal registration we provide <strong>demo classes</strong> to facilitate a <strong>one on one interaction</strong> with the students at absolutely <strong>NO COST!!!</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Regular internal assesment tests</strong> helps us to keep a track of the student's progress which also enables us to look into individual problems of students and support them to overcome it.</p>
		<p>As much as we understand and prioritise academic learning and formal education, we believe in simultaneous <strong>intellectual developement</strong> of our student as well. At Mentor Classrooms we encourage <strong>musical training</strong> for the same reason.
			Learning music <strong>promotes craftmanship</strong>, helps develop the areas of our brain that are related to language, <strong>reasoning, memory and discipline</strong>. It also helps us to <strong>reduce stress and depression</strong>. Generally, most of the students suffers from depression and stress. Hence, to overcome these we have decided <strong>to provide learning of music(Keyboard) under the same roof</strong>.
			Students who are interested in learning music apart from studies can take this course.</p>
